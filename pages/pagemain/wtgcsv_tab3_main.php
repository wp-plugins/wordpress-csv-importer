<strong>Developed in 2012</strong><br />
<strong>Alpha released June 2012</strong><br />
<strong>Beta release July 2012</strong>
</p>

<p>Wordpress CSV Importer is an advanced data import and post creation plugin. The plugin is ready to use for data
importing, that is part of this plugins function. Auto-blogging is half of the plugins function with the data import
features supporting the design of the post creation features in auto-blogging areas of the plugin. Wordpress CSV Importer
is ready for use, it just may not have all required features for all projects due to it still being an Alpha. I'm
keeping it in Alpha status to avoid confusion with users who are only seeking a post creation plugin. That area of the
plugin still needs a week of work as I type this.</p> 

<p>I have also not started documentation which will be extensive. The interface offers help content and links directly
too dedicated pages per feature, but the content is yet to be written. I do not want users to be under the impression that I feel
enough has been done and so it will stay in Alpha status for 2-3 more weeks.</p>

<h4>Still Under Construction - No Public Rating Or Negative Feedback Please</h4>
<p>The plugin is being released due to requests from the Wordpress public. I have many users and buyers of the full
edition who want the current working features to be easily available, as the plugin can be of much use right now. Please
respect this and understand even users have a stake in the plugin. Many members of the Wordpress community have spent
much time sending feeding so that this plugin is developed as needed. Please do not discuss any issues the plugin may
have or unfinished areas until it is no longer in Alpha or Beta status. Thank you for this.</p>

<h4>Example Features Still To Be Complete</h4>
<p>I have an endless list of features still be added but most improvements will be aimed at making the plugin
easier. A feature to be
complete is the Question system where users answer questions and the plugin configures the interface using the users
answers. I also plan to add a progress menu that displays on all pages for quickly jumping to any screen. 
The interface has been designed so that data import is done seperate from any post creation configuration. This plugin allows users to use existing database
tables for post creation and configure multiple auto-blogging projects to be active the same time. It can be simple to
use once you know what features to ignore and if you require a wide range of the most advanced features you will find
it has a lot to offer.</p>

<p>I would like to give a big thank you to everyone who has waited with patience as the plugin was developed and
delayed at least 2 months. The plugin is ready for use for data importing and basic post creation. The paid edition 
is not ready for sale as it does not offer advanced post creation but those features are being added right now
and will be complete at the end of June 2012.</p>

<h4>Free and Paid Editions</h4>
<p>It is my objective to create a free edition that offers a useful tool for data import and post creation. A goal
for the free edition is to offer a good starting point to anyone who seeks to create/customize a CSV importer to
suit their own specific needs. This will require a lot of documentation and explination of all features in detail. I
plan to create a blog page per panel shown on the plugins interface and a video for each even if just a short clip.</p>
<p>The paid edition offers more advanced and complicated features which would not only generate a lot of support
requests if giving free but some of them require SOAP Web Services to work. These running costs can only be covered
by selling a more advanced plugin, for complex projects. One of the biggest goals for the paid edition is to
reduce administration time for users by automating tasks they would normally do manually. Sometimes this requires
custom functions/features which is delivered as quick as possible.</p>
