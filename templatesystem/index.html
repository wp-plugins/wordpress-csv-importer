  <p>This file should be found in the Template System folder. The Template System is the term for all the
  files making up the core plugin. My idea is to be able to use the template plugin without having to
  edit any of the files within the Template Systems (excluding page files or interface text that may conflict
  with the plugin being created). Some files such as those making up the actual tab screens and pages may be
  made part of the Module System seeing how they will change constantly. Users could also add or remove their
  own pages easy enough, something developers will be keen on doing. This may not be done during 2012 though
  it is just something I'm considering.</p>
