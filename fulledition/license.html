<h1>Plugin Software and Services License</h1>
<p>Updated 25th April 2012 by Zara Walsh</p> 

<p>Please request a refund for services or products paid for if you disagree with any of the terms laid out below.</p>
                                
<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p>All software is Copyrighted and protected by terms to which you agree to by using the software.
These terms of use apply to all plugins developed by Zara Walsh plugins and themes for Wordpress. 
These terms include membership and subscriptions or any type of credits offered by Zara Walsh. 
WebTechGlobal grants you a non-exclusive limited license to use products sold through any 
website with permission to sell our software, in accordance with the following terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>1. Memberships, Subscription and Credits</h2>

<p>Products and services developed by Zara Walsh are available through different memberships. Memberships provide a permanent
access for a set number of uses also known as licenses. Subscriptions provide access too services for a specific 
period and credits can be spent when you choose on either products, more licenses or to extend services.
We are currently improving these three elements and hope to offer a highly flexible service. If you feel any of the
terms do not suit you, please contact info@wordpresscsvimporter.com and discuss it with us.</p>

<h2>2. License</h2>

<h3>2.1. Ownership</h3>

<p>Any products modified or unmodified are not your property. You do not own them. 
They are property of Zara Walsh. Images package with extensions or plugins are often licenses for use within
those softwares only and not for use elsewhere. Purchased of licenses for all images exists
with most restricting their use, no Copyrights are giving with your purchase. Where images are provided for your
own use it will be clearly stated.</p>

<h3>2.2. Unauthorized Use</h3>

<p>It is not permitted to put our products in a modified or changed or even unmodified version on a disk, 
unsecure website, P2P or any other medium and use it for resale purposes. This means you are not allowed 
to set up our products for demonstration purposes to promote them to your customers. You must have an
Unlimited License Membership if you want to use our software or services as part of your own service and to
install or provide a client access to said software or services.</p> 

You may install our products and make use of our services anywhere within a DOMAIN. This means you can
install software on multiple sites on a single domain. A domain is treated as a whole, you must continue
subscribing in order for member support services to be provided to every site on the domain.</p>

<h3>2.3. Unlimited Licenses</h3>

<p>If a membership grants you unlimited licenses of a WebTechGlobal product you are allowed to use the product 
in all your client projects but it does NOT allow the redistribution of the product in any form. Using a 
WebTechGlobal product for your client projects is only granted if you primarily sell your service to your 
client and not the product itself. If you wish to continue the usage of the product for new website projects 
you may need to upgrade your membership and if you wish WebTechGlobal to provide your clients with our members
web services you will need to ensure your subscription is paid. (we are open to providing special services
for any developers who expect levels of use such as giving you pre-made product keys but we require a discussion
first, currently you must activate all software using your own product or service key).</p>

<h3>2.4. Modifications </h3>

<p>You are allowed to make any changes and modifications in the themes or products to suit your needs. We welcome it
and will even help you. However it is not permitted to change or remove the copyright information in the source code.
This includes all PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS files distributed with our products.</p> 

<p>Visual copyrights, for example the copyrights in our theme footers or plugin admin footers, can be removed. We want
to support you in providing public and client services that appear to becoming directly from you.</p>

<p>You are not allowed to resale or redistribute on the basis you made changes and modifications. You cannot
release WebTechGlobal products with GPL included or similar licenses. It is strictly prohibited to port 
WebTechGlobal plugins or themes included in our extensions to other platforms and content management systems. Doing
so will infringe on active business plans and investment as you are using our own product against us in competition,
we take this very seriously.</p>

<h3>2.5. Assignability</h3>

<p>It is not allowed to sub-license, assign, or transfer your licenses to anyone in terms of an account held for you
by WebTechGlobal. What you ARE allowed to do is use and share the account within a small development business of no
more than 10 staff (we are considering account management tools that manage multiple user login, please let us 
know if this interests you, we will need to confirm details of your business).</p>

If you wish to share access to your WebTechGlobal account and your business employs more than 10 staff then you must
request a Commercial License at the point of purchase. Commercial Licenses
allow for very high levels use which we do monitor closely i.e. multiple users at any one time at a rate that has to be
managed efficienctly. None Commercial use is considered to be a small business or group of students
who will use a product or services either very occasionally or for a short period of time.</p>

<h3>2.6. Demo Content</h3>

<p>Re-use of any graphics, icons or photos from the demo content for any purpose is strictly prohibited unless
stated otherwise. Some of our products or services will come with graphics you are permitted to use how you wish. 
The demo content is for demonstration purposes only, some of it is not owned by WebTechGlobal but we are licensed
to use it. You may use configuration/settings from demos and we will try to provide a copy of the actual database data.</p>

<h2>3. Product Delivery</h2>

<p>As soon as you have carried out payment and we can acknowledge receipt of the money, we will email you your 
membership and subscription information where applicable. In case you have not received an email from 
WebTechGlobal within 1 hour, please contact us by sending an email to info@wordpresscsvimporter.com and we will 
resend you the login details manually. After receiving our email with your account details you have immediate 
access to your download. The email address you give should be valid as we will use it to contact you. 
We therefore recommend to use your main email address.</p>

<h2>4. Support</h2>

<p>We provide different levels of technical support for WebTechGlobal plugins and themes.
Your level of support will usually begin with the full range of services and tools available then eventually downgrade to a basic/general support.
Member support includes the use of Web Services that work via our SOAP Web Services. Access to these Web Services is the
main difference between Member and Basic support. If you do not continue to subscribe you will not continue
to get access to Member Support Services.</p>

<p>Member Support Services (Web Services) are giving priority and contact methods via Web Services are far more efficient.
It will be clear when using a contact method that uses the Web Services and is part of Member Support Services.
Basic support is only accepted via email. By 2013 a question and answer system will be in place also. If you contact us via
email in request for support, most of the time the email will either be deleted or we may copy the request to a new
thread on the forum where we will request you to reply. Basic support services are usually enough to overcome any issues
and ofcrouse in special circumstances we will provide a higher level of support especially when it concerns a problem
within our product or service.</p> 

<p>Member Support Services are as hands on as possible, this is something we cannot afford to provide without
subscription. We will try to complete requested upgrades required for your project and generally help you get
started. Member Support Services do not entitle you to have projects complete where projects involve the use of 
or products or services. We can support you through your project with consultation.</p>

<p>We will not provide any support via email, Facebook, Twitter or any Instant Message software. These methods cause
a breakdown in communication especially when multiple members of staff need to participate in the support.</p>

<p>We try to reply within 48 hours. However where your enquiry is regarding a fault with a service, product or website
we may be in the process of responding to the issue by fixing it. Response is then giving in a more public way rather
than replying to everyone individually. This does depend on the number of people a fault effects however.</p>

<h3>4.1 Support Ending With Refund Request</h3>

<p>Refunds are NOT giving on the basis that we have not replied within 48 hours however if 72 hours have passed without
a reply by our support service you are entitled to partial refund, not compensation, where a fault is proved to be caused by our service or product.
Proof will usually come when we investigate the issue and apply a fix. We require at least 48 hours in most cases to
locate faults, fix them and We are more than happy to refund fully if for 
any reason a fault does cause adverse negative effects or we feel that a fix will not be delivered.</p> 

<h2>5. Refund Policy </h2>

<p>Since WebTechGlobal is offering non-tangible irrevocable software products please contact us describing your
situation and reason for refund requests. If mutual agreement cannot be reached regarding your issues,
in this case a refund will be provided.</p> 

<p>You must give us 48 hours to come to a conclusion. During this time we will investigate any problems you have
experienced. We will reject all refunds until sufficient information or evidence is giving regarding claimed faults.
As a gesture of goodwill where faults are found with our products or services we will often allow users to continue
using the product or service with Member Subscriber status. This is not always the case however and in most cases
when a refund is giving your membership is revoked and all licenses are revoked for said product.</p>

<h2>6. Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Any information submitted by the buyer will be used solely for the purpose of completing the transaction, 
delivering the product, providing Member Support Services via web services, informing about new product 
releases and addressing any customer service issues.</p>

<h2>7. Warranty</h2>

<p>WebTechGlobal gives no warranty or guarantee for our plugins,themes and extensions in any manner. The nature of
Web Development especially within Joomla, osCommerce, phpBB and WordPress or other Content Management Solutions allows for all possible
problems or damage to easily be reduced or avoided with simple steps. We are not liable if you do not take the correct
measures to protect/secure your installation of Joomla, osCommerce, phpBB and WordPress or other solution, your general website status, database data
or files. This generally means backing everything up before using any software or service.</p>
 
<p>Browser compatibility should be tested viewing the demonstration installations on the demo sites. Your purchase of our
product or service is also your admission that you are happy with the product or service in every possible manner
that the product or service can be experienced in before purchase.</p> 

<p>We cannot give you the guarantee that the products will work with all third party plugins/extensions. Refunds will not be giving
for lack of compatability unless we have stated integration of third party plugins/extensions or themes. Each product 
has a very different purpose, some require their own terms for compatibility and these usually lay in the sales information.</p> 

<p>We guarantee that our plugins and themes work with the current version of Joomla, osCommerce, phpBB and WordPress.</p> 

<p>We cannot guarantee though that they will work with future versions of Joomla, osCommerce, phpBB and WordPress. 
Also, WebTechGlobal products will always be developed for the latest Joomla and WordPress version. When you purchase
any product you are buying it for the latest version it was developed for, in most cases this will be the latest
version available as we update products regularly.</p> 

<h2>8. Credits</h2>

<p>WebTechGlobal will gradually increase the use of Credits which customers can spend on products and services.
This system is new for 2012 and will not have wide application until 2013.</p>

<p>Credits have no monitory value, they cannot be refunded in the form of money. WebTechGlobal have the right to 
change the Credit cost of any product or service. We also include the right to change the Credit reward giving
with our products or services without prior notice but we must notify you of such changes.</p>

<h2>9. Terms & Conditions</h2>

<p>WebTechGlobal reserves the right to change or modify current Terms Of Use at any time with no prior notice. 
Therefore, we encourage you to review changes to our privacy policy every time you visit this website to make
a purchase. We will try to increase notification of changes where the changes apply to a large number of clauses
or we predict that a change may cause discontent with existing users of our software.</p>

<p>WebTechGlobal reserves the right to modify or discontinue any portion of the membership. In such circumstances
the applicable refund will be giving for the term of service paid for but not yet giving. 
WebTechGlobal shall not be liable to you or any third party should WebTechGlobal exercise its right to modify, suspend, 
limit or discontinue any feature of your membership or subscription. We do not need to give a reason especially where
it concerns issues such as security or law but we will always try to be as transparent as possible. Such changes are 
very rare and we will try to warn users of our software before changes take place.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of changes to software or services before using them on a new site. It
is also your responsibility to take notice of change notes provided with software. It is our responsibility to provide
such notes and they must be accurate. Where we fail to meet this condition and a change not stated has a negative effect
within your site we will issue a full refund of the purchase membership covering the effected site, not subscription
or parts of membership for other sites that you wish to continue using our software on. </p>
