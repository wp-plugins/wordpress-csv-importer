<h1>Plugin Software and Services License</h1>
<p>Updated 25th April 2012 by Zara Walsh</p> 

<p>Please request a refund for services or products paid for if you disagree with any of the terms laid out below.</p>
                                
<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p>All software is Copyrighted and protected by terms to which you agree to by using the software.
These terms of use apply to all plugins developed by Zara Walsh plugins and themes for Wordpress. 
These terms include membership and subscriptions or any type of credits offered by Zara Walsh. 
WebTechGlobal grants you a non-exclusive limited license to use products sold through any 
website with permission to sell our software, in accordance with the following terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>1. Memberships, Subscription and Credits</h2>

<p>Products and services developed by Zara Walsh are available through different memberships. Memberships provide a permanent
access for a set number of uses also known as licenses. Subscriptions provide access too services for a specific 
period and credits can be spent when you choose on either products, more licenses or to extend services.
We are currently improving these three elements and hope to offer a highly flexible service. If you feel any of the
terms do not suit you, please contact info@wordpresscsvimporter.com and discuss it with us.</p>

<h2>2. License</h2>

<h3>2.1. Ownership</h3>

<p>Any products modified or unmodified are not your property. You do not own them. 
They are property of Zara Walsh. Images package with extensions or plugins are often licenses for use within
those softwares only and not for use elsewhere. Purchased of licenses for all images exists
with most restricting their use, no Copyrights are giving with your purchase. Where images are provided for your
own use it will be clearly stated.</p>

<h3>2.2. Unauthorized Use</h3>

<p>It is not permitted to put our products in a modified or changed or even unmodified version on a disk, 
unsecure website, P2P or any other medium and use it for resale purposes. This means you are not allowed 
to set up our products for demonstration purposes to promote them to your customers. You must have an
Unlimited License Membership if you want to use our software or services as part of your own service and to
install or provide a client access to said software or services.</p> 

You may install our products and make use of our services anywhere within a DOMAIN. This means you can
install software on multiple sites on a single domain. A domain is treated as a whole, you must continue
subscribing in order for member support services to be provided to every site on the domain.</p>

<h3>2.3. Unlimited Licenses</h3>

<p>If a membership grants you unlimited licenses of a WebTechGlobal product you are allowed to use the product 
in all your client projects but it does NOT allow the redistribution of the product in any form. Using a 
WebTechGlobal product for your client projects is only granted if you primarily sell your service to your 
client and not the product itself. If you wish to continue the usage of the product for new website projects 
you may need to upgrade your membership and if you wish WebTechGlobal to provide your clients with our members
web services you will need to ensure your subscription is paid. (we are open to providing special services
for any developers who expect levels of use such as giving you pre-made product keys but we require a discussion
first, currently you must activate all software using your own product or service key).</p>

<h3>2.4. Modifications </h3>

<p>You are allowed to make any changes and modifications in the themes or products to suit your needs. We welcome it
and will even help you. However it is not permitted to change or remove the copyright information in the source code.
This includes all PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS files distributed with our products.</p> 

<p>Visual copyrights, for example the copyrights in our theme footers or plugin admin footers, can be removed. We want
to support you in providing public and client services that appear to becoming directly from you.</p>

<p>You are not allowed to resale or redistribute on the basis you made changes and modifications. You cannot
release WebTechGlobal products with GPL included or similar licenses. It is strictly prohibited to port 
WebTechGlobal plugins or themes included in our extensions to other platforms and content management systems. Doing
so will infringe on active business plans and investment as you are using our own product against us in competition,
we take this very seriously.</p>

<h3>2.5. Assignability</h3>

<p>It is not allowed to sub-license, assign, or transfer your licenses to anyone in terms of an account held for you
by WebTechGlobal. What you ARE allowed to do is use and share the account within a small development business of no
more than 10 staff (we are considering account management tools that manage multiple user login, please let us 
know if this interests you, we will need to confirm details of your business).</p>

If you wish to share access to your WebTechGlobal account and your business employs more than 10 staff then you must
request a Commercial License at the point of purchase. Commercial Licenses
allow for very high levels use which we do monitor closely i.e. multiple users at any one time at a rate that has to be
managed efficienctly. None Commercial use is considered to be a small business or group of students
who will use a product or services either very occasionally or for a short period of time.</p>

<h3>2.6. Demo Content</h3>

<p>Re-use of any graphics, icons or photos from the demo content for any purpose is strictly prohibited unless
stated otherwise. Some of our products or services will come with graphics you are permitted to use how you wish. 
The demo content is for demonstration purposes only, some of it is not owned by WebTechGlobal but we are licensed
to use it. You may use configuration/settings from demos and we will try to provide a copy of the actual database data.</p>

<h2>3. Product Delivery</h2>

<p>As soon as you have carried out payment and we can acknowledge receipt of the money, we will email you your 
membership and subscription information where applicable. In case you have not received an email from 
WebTechGlobal within 1 hour, please contact us by sending an email to info@wordpresscsvimporter.com and we will 
resend you the login details manually. After receiving our email with your account details you have immediate 
access to your download. The email address you give should be valid as we will use it to contact you. 
We therefore recommend to use your main email address.</p>

<h2>4. Support</h2>

<p>We provide different levels of technical support for WebTechGlobal plugins and themes.
Your level of support will usually begin with the full range of services and tools available then eventually downgrade to a basic/general support.
Member support includes the use of Web Services that work via our SOAP Web Services. Access to these Web Services is the
main difference between Member and Basic support. If you do not continue to subscribe you will not continue
to get access to Member Support Services.</p>

<p>Member Support Services (Web Services) are giving priority and contact methods via Web Services are far more efficient.
It will be clear when using a contact method that uses the Web Services and is part of Member Support Services.
Basic support is only accepted via email. By 2013 a question and answer system will be in place also. If you contact us via
email in request for support, most of the time the email will either be deleted or we may copy the request to a new
thread on the forum where we will request you to reply. Basic support services are usually enough to overcome any issues
and ofcrouse in special circumstances we will provide a higher level of support especially when it concerns a problem
within our product or service.</p> 

<p>Member Support Services are as hands on as possible, this is something we cannot afford to provide without
subscription. We will try to complete requested upgrades required for your project and generally help you get
started. Member Support Services do not entitle you to have projects complete where projects involve the use of 
or products or services. We can support you through your project with consultation.</p>

<p>We will not provide any support via email, Facebook, Twitter or any Instant Message software. These methods cause
a breakdown in communication especially when multiple members of staff need to participate in the support.</p>

<p>We try to reply within 48 hours. However where your enquiry is regarding a fault with a service, product or website
we may be in the process of responding to the issue by fixing it. Response is then giving in a more public way rather
than replying to everyone individually. This does depend on the number of people a fault effects however.</p>

<h3>4.1 Support Ending With Refund Request</h3>

<p>Refunds are NOT giving on the basis that we have not replied within 48 hours however if 72 hours have passed without
a reply by our support service you are entitled to partial refund, not compensation, where a fault is proved to be caused by our service or product.
Proof will usually come when we investigate the issue and apply a fix. We require at least 48 hours in most cases to
locate faults, fix them and We are more than happy to refund fully if for 
any reason a fault does cause adverse negative effects or we feel that a fix will not be delivered.</p> 

<h2>5. Refund Policy </h2>

<p>Since WebTechGlobal is offering non-tangible irrevocable software products please contact us describing your
situation and reason for refund requests. If mutual agreement cannot be reached regarding your issues,
in this case a refund will be provided.</p> 

<p>You must give us 48 hours to come to a conclusion. During this time we will investigate any problems you have
experienced. We will reject all refunds until sufficient information or evidence is giving regarding claimed faults.
As a gesture of goodwill where faults are found with our products or services we will often allow users to continue
using the product or service with Member Subscriber status. This is not always the case however and in most cases
when a refund is giving your membership is revoked and all licenses are revoked for said product.</p>

<h2>6. Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Any information submitted by the buyer will be used solely for the purpose of completing the transaction, 
delivering the product, providing Member Support Services via web services, informing about new product 
releases and addressing any customer service issues.</p>

<h2>7. Warranty</h2>

<p>WebTechGlobal gives no warranty or guarantee for our plugins,themes and extensions in any manner. The nature of
Web Development especially within Joomla, osCommerce, phpBB and WordPress or other Content Management Solutions allows for all possible
problems or damage to easily be reduced or avoided with simple steps. We are not liable if you do not take the correct
measures to protect/secure your installation of Joomla, osCommerce, phpBB and WordPress or other solution, your general website status, database data
or files. This generally means backing everything up before using any software or service.</p>
 
<p>Browser compatibility should be tested viewing the demonstration installations on the demo sites. Your purchase of our
product or service is also your admission that you are happy with the product or service in every possible manner
that the product or service can be experienced in before purchase.</p> 

<p>We cannot give you the guarantee that the products will work with all third party plugins/extensions. Refunds will not be giving
for lack of compatability unless we have stated integration of third party plugins/extensions or themes. Each product 
has a very different purpose, some require their own terms for compatibility and these usually lay in the sales information.</p> 

<p>We guarantee that our plugins and themes work with the current version of Joomla, osCommerce, phpBB and WordPress.</p> 

<p>We cannot guarantee though that they will work with future versions of Joomla, osCommerce, phpBB and WordPress. 
Also, WebTechGlobal products will always be developed for the latest Joomla and WordPress version. When you purchase
any product you are buying it for the latest version it was developed for, in most cases this will be the latest
version available as we update products regularly.</p> 

<h2>8. Credits</h2>

<p>WebTechGlobal will gradually increase the use of Credits which customers can spend on products and services.
This system is new for 2012 and will not have wide application until 2013.</p>

<p>Credits have no monitory value, they cannot be refunded in the form of money. WebTechGlobal have the right to 
change the Credit cost of any product or service. We also include the right to change the Credit reward giving
with our products or services without prior notice but we must notify you of such changes.</p>

<h2>9. Terms & Conditions</h2>

<p>WebTechGlobal reserves the right to change or modify current Terms Of Use at any time with no prior notice. 
Therefore, we encourage you to review changes to our privacy policy every time you visit this website to make
a purchase. We will try to increase notification of changes where the changes apply to a large number of clauses
or we predict that a change may cause discontent with existing users of our software.</p>

<p>WebTechGlobal reserves the right to modify or discontinue any portion of the membership. In such circumstances
the applicable refund will be giving for the term of service paid for but not yet giving. 
WebTechGlobal shall not be liable to you or any third party should WebTechGlobal exercise its right to modify, suspend, 
limit or discontinue any feature of your membership or subscription. We do not need to give a reason especially where
it concerns issues such as security or law but we will always try to be as transparent as possible. Such changes are 
very rare and we will try to warn users of our software before changes take place.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of changes to software or services before using them on a new site. It
is also your responsibility to take notice of change notes provided with software. It is our responsibility to provide
such notes and they must be accurate. Where we fail to meet this condition and a change not stated has a negative effect
within your site we will issue a full refund of the purchase membership covering the effected site, not subscription
or parts of membership for other sites that you wish to continue using our software on. </p>


<h1>Wordpress License (GPLv2)</h1>
The GPLv2 (or later) from the Free Software Foundation is the license that the WordPress software is under. Its text follows.

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software — to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU General Public License Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification
This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
